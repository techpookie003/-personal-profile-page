	 <p class="bio"> Hi! I'm a passionate calligraphy artist who turns simple handwriting into beautiful art.
	 I love helping beginners discover the magic of strokes, letters and expression through ink. <br> I believe
	 that anyone even with the worst handwriting, can create something beautiful and meaningful. That was how
	 I started too.<br> i had no fancy handwriting but my teacher made it clear that anyone can learn calligraphy.</p>
